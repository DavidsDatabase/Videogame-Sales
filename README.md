# Produce Cost

### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on the video game sales that's varied by their genre, platform, publisher, and even region. By analyzing some KPIs from the dataset, we look to identify any trends, make data-driven recommendations, and hopefully gauge on  future video game sales.

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales/data>. This dataset has data regarding current and previous sales of many different games and their sub-categories.

### Tools Used

- Python - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Sorting and Filtering
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which Genre generated the most sales? most popular?
2. Which Platform created the most games and sales? least?
3. Which Publisher company created the most games? least?
4. Which games generated the most global sales?
5. How many games were developed every year?
6. What are the average regional sales percentage?

### Results/Findings

1. 'Action' genre appears to have the most global sales out of all the genres. Following that are 'Sports' and 'Shooters', all exceeding $1 billion. These top 3 genres are the most popular amongst consumers and video game enthusiasts.

PS2 appears to have the most sales by platform. Many people seem to like the performance of the PS2 and demand is certainly there. It tops the second highest platform by $264 million in sales. It is also noteworthy that the top 6 platforms are substantially higher than the platforms afterwards. Sales from the top 6 are double, triple, and even quadruple than those below.

3. Electronic Arts, Activision, and Namco Bandai Games are the top three publishers for creating the most games. They've made nearly 1,000 titles each by themselves throughout the whole video game industry.

4. Wii Sports appears to have the most global sales, $82.7 million, almost doubling of second place, Super Mario Bros. From the query, we can see the top 5 games are all from Nintendo. This could mean Nintendo games have appealed to the general public far better than any other publishers like Sony or Microsoft. A deeper analysis may be needed to find the reasons as to why this is. Are Nintendo products more affordable versus their competitors? Are the games more suitable for all ages, and much more?

5. It appears that 2009 had the most games sold. Following that are years that are near the best year. It may seem that towards the end of the 2010s, more and more games were being developed acrossed many platforms and sold.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Companies that produce games should seek to create games that fall within the genres of Action, Sports, Shooter, Role-Playing, and Platform to attract the most customers and sales. 
- Top game sales consisted of 'Wii Sports' and 'Mario' in their titles could mean games that contain these words in their titles generate high sales and are popular. Nintendo is the publisher for both of these titles which could mean they are top-tier publisher that garners many game sales.
- The North American region appears to have the overall highest average sales globally. Consumers from North America contribute to global sales drastically. Game developers should target North America as its main audience for games as they almost make nearly half of global sales.
- As time progresses, the older games lose out in popularity and thus, less sales. A further analysis would be needed on current games and possibly new platforms and/or publishers. 

### Limitations

These initial findings may spark some interest, but further analysis would be needed for more concrete results. For example, it would be helpful to group certain platforms as they originate from the same publisher, such as the PS, PS2, PS3. Afterwards, another analysis can be done to compare publishers to ascertain which publisher is top-tier. Also, knowing why a certain game outperforms others would be helpful as that can be used to gauge on why it became popular and in demand.
